MCUT (pronounced ‘emcut’) is a tool for cutting meshes. It is a library for 
partitioning 2-manifold polygon meshes in order to perform operations like 
slicing, stenciling, boolean operations and more using a single interface.

MCUT partitions shapes as meshes directly from input data composed of geometry 
and connectivity to produce crisp fragments at fine scale. There are no 
precomputed discretizations like tetrahedral decompositions or signed distance 
fields (voxel level sets). MCUT uses a breakthrough procedure that we invented 
to achieve robustness with reliability, and it is the only existing method that 
properly cuts arbitrary-planar polygon meshes with no requirement for 
triangulation on meshes.
